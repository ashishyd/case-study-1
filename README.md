You have been assigned to the team that develops weather applications. The current challenge faced by the team is that the app is hosted on a single server causing downtime during server maintenance and updates, resulting in the service being unavailable for users. The intended solution is to leverage Kubernetes, a popular open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and managing containerized applications. The architect has recommended using Kubernetes to manage the app, which will help achieve high availability, ensuring that the app will remain up and running even during server downtime.

The container image of the app is available in Docker Hub. A Kubernetes cluster with a single node has already been provisioned. The deployment and service files have been preconfigured by the architect, containing 2 replica sets to ensure that there are always two instances of the app running, providing high availability. As the team member responsible for this task, you need to create and apply the deployment manifest, which will define the desired state of the app, including the number of replicas and the resources required. Name the deployment manifest file brezyweather-deployment.yml. You will then expose the application through a Kubernetes service with appropriate port mapping to the containers. Name the service manifest file brezyweather-service.yml. Finally, you should test the BrezyWeather API app using the CURL command to ensure it is functioning as expected.
